# PPPoE Retriever

Python script designed to retrieve PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) credentials from routers that are restricted or locked down by ISPs (Internet Service Providers). This tool is particularly useful for those who need to manage or reconfigure network settings but encounter difficulties accessing credentials due to ISP-imposed restrictions.

> **Note:** Limited to Ethernet WAN Routers

## Features

- **Retrieve PPPoE Credentials**: Extract PPPoE usernames and passwords from routers that are typically locked down by ISPs.
- **Support for Multiple Routers**: Works with various router models and ISPs, with support for additional models to be added in future updates.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.
- **Cross platform**: Works on Windows, Linux and MacOS
- **Self contain**: No installation or setup needed, Python frozen binaries available to download.

## Installation

No need to install, you can find frozen-binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows under the [release page](https://github.com/guillermodotn/pppoe-retriever/releases/latest).

## Usage

1. Connect the router WAN port to you computer using a Ethernet cable.
